# Description
OMG. I HATE WINDOWS UPDATE. HOW CAN YOU AUTO UPDATE WHEN IM 80% DONE WITH MY ASSIGNMENT. I DIDN’T SAVE ANYTHING, IT BETTER AUTO RECOVERS. 
Browsing the desktop, we found the assignment in question. But opening the document file, no flags can be found. Judging from the description of the challenge, the flag must in a new, unsaved version of the file.

A quick research tells us that when you’re working on files, they are backed up in AppData Roaming so that you can recover these files.

We then found the autorecovery file in the directory.

Viewing the file in a text editor, we can see the newer version of the file and the flag is seen here.
