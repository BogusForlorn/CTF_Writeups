# Description 
I wrote the flag in the notepad and accidentally closed it. Will I lose the flag? 


# Solution 
Similar to the previous challenge, a text editor was closed without saving it. But unlike Microsoft Words, which saves the file temporarily to be recovered, notepad is too simple and doesnâ€™t contain this feature. So, we had to do some digging and research. 
From a superuser forum, I found a thread of possible directories to look for.

So I went to look for the 
AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsNotepad_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState and sure enough, found something of interest.

Opening the file, we can see the flag.
