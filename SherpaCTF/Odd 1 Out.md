In this challenge, we're given a vcan log file. We can take a closer look at the contents of the file to see what its about.

This vcan log seems like its a bunch of hexdump of some sort. Vcan is simple a virtual CAN interface, and CAN (Bus) is a message-based protocol that allows devices to communicate. Something about these numbers hold data about the flag and its been setup in a virtual CAN environment.

Before I get to my solution, let's talk about what I've tried:

Unique responses

I wanted to see if there were any unique data in the hexdump. Perhaps an encoded string about the flag. But of course, my script doesn't seem to work.

I then used awk to get the unique logs

Still nothing interesting here.


Replay VCAN Interface

I also attempted to mount vcan0 to my machine in hopes of replaying the data that was send out. I thought if I could replay the data the way the interface had received it, maybe I could get an idea of what was being transmitted.
Here I just used these simple commands to setup:
```
cansend vcan0
lsmod | grep vcan
```


**The real solution:**

I pasted the hexdump of the vcan log into cyberchef to see if any of the cipher options could decode it.

Aha! IHDR header. We found something here. I've only applied the hexadecimal to ascii option thus far.

Cleaning up my data input a bit to get a clearer picture, I then exported the ascii output into a txt file for faster searching.

And here I found a PNG header. I knew a PNG file was in here somewhere.
My next order of business was to look where this PNG header came from in the original log. And I found the origin by searching the magic numbers for the PNG header.

It seems that every PNG-related header was marked by #800. So that's my bet, #800.

I made a script that extracts only the #800 hexdumps and wrote it into a file. 
Viewing it in hexed.it, we can see its a complete image.

And here we have found our flag!
