Name: two-frames-one-champ

Description: Lake Champlain has always been a hotspot for mysterious sightings, but it seems like something recently odd came up. Apparently an old cryptid hunter went missing after attempting to reveal his findings. Rumors have been spreading that the cryptid hunter was once affiliated with the Consortium. But anything they left behind? An broken hard drive. Simon was able to recover the hard drive. Unfortunately, he was only able to recover two images files that are corrupted, likely tampered by the Consortium. Anna is tasking you to JOIN Simon piece this puzzle TOGETHER to uncover what the Consortium are hiding.

The challenge gives us 2 .PNG files, both of which are broken. Going to hexed.it, it's a simple fix by repairing the PNG header.
From the challenge description, we get the hint that we need to 'JOIN' 'TOGETHER'. I'm simply going to use stegsolve and combine the images.

And that's our flag.
