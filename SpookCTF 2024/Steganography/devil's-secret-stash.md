Name: devil's-secret-stash

Description: In the depths of the Pine Barrens, a cryptic legend whispers of the Jersey Devil guarding a picture. Tales speak of forgotten knowledge sealed within, but only those sharp enough to see the truth can unlock its secrets. The key? The key hiding in plain sight, woven into the eerie folklore itself, waiting for the chosen few to discover and reveal the dark treasures within.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8c93035-0d1a-4494-870c-5aec64d67ca8)

Like usual, some reconnaissance first.

There seems to be a file hidden within the JPEG. A handy binwalk would help us here.

After using binwalk to extract the hidden file, the embedded file turns out to be a password protected zip.
No issue here, we'll just bruteforce it.

After getting the password '250250' and extracting the contents of the zip file, we can get the flag.
